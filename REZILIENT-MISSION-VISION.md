# REZILIENT.js Mission & Vision

## Mission
Empower developers and organizations to build applications that remain functional, secure, and accessible in any environmentâ€”especially in areas with network instability, crisis zones, and regions with limited or no internet access. REZILIENT.js is designed to ensure digital equity, sustainability, and reliability for all.

## Vision
To set a new global standard for resilient-first software development, where every app is:
- **Offline-first**: Works seamlessly without internet connectivity.
- **Carbon-aware**: Minimizes energy consumption and environmental impact.
- **Accessibility-first**: Usable by everyone, regardless of ability or circumstance.
- **Self-healing**: Detects and recovers from failures automatically.
- **AI-bias detection**: Proactively identifies and mitigates algorithmic bias.
- **Quantum-ready**: Prepared for future advances in quantum computing.

## Why REZILIENT.js?
- **Digital Inclusion**: Bridging the gap for underserved communities and crisis areas.
- **Sustainability**: Reducing the carbon footprint of digital infrastructure.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring mission-critical apps never go offline.
- **Security**: Protecting data and privacy even in unstable conditions.

## Methodology
REZILIENT.js absorbs the best parts of PWA/SPA technologies and philosophies, combining them with new resilient patterns:
- Service workers for offline caching and background sync.
- Modular architecture for easy extension and maintenance.
- Automated accessibility and carbon audits.
- Built-in support for self-healing and bias detection.

## Get Involved
- **Open Source**: 100% free and open for contributions.
- **Community Driven**: Join us to shape the future of resilient software.
- **Adopt the Methodology**: Use REZILIENT.js principles in your own projects, or adopt the framework directly.
